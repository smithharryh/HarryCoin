I've been intrigued by crypto for a wee while, but have never explored it particularly deeply. I own a tiny amount of bitcoin and have done for a couple of years which is cool but my understanding of how it works have been surface level. I haven't written much Python in the last few months so I thought the best way to learn would be to build my own cryptocurrency from scratch in Python. My main guide is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46"> here</a>, but I'll be taking inspiration from other places I'll reference on my github <a href= "#">here</a>. My stretch goal would be to host it on my Raspberry Pi but for now I'll focus on writing the code.
